Oh, how I regret not seizing that golden opportunity to start my tech career earlier.
 It was back in my innocent first year of university when my dearest friend and roommate, Tomiwa, 
 suggested that we delve into the enchanting world of web development. At the time, I foolishly dismissed the idea, failing to recognize the magic that lay ahead.

 <br><br>

In my naivety, I wondered why I should bother learning a new skill when I was already immersed in my university studies.
 "What could web development possibly add to my life?" I ignorantly questioned.

Living life as carefree as can be, I was content with my monthly allowance and the thrill of campus adventures. 
There seemed to be no reason to devote myself to learning something new when everything appeared so perfect.

<br><br>

But Tomiwa saw it differently. He had an unwavering dedication to mastering web development. Every month,
 he set aside a portion of his allowance to invest in online courses. Though I couldn't quite comprehend the depth of his vision at the time,
  I would sometimes support him financially, hoping to be a good friend.

  <br><br>

As I continued with my mundane academic and extracurricular routines, Tomiwa was on a relentless pursuit of knowledge in web development.
 He never missed a class, and every spare moment was devoted to honing his skills. Time was precious to him, 
 and his laptop became an extension of his very soul.

 <br><br>

As the days turned into weeks and weeks into months, Tomiwa's passion for his newfound skill intensified.
 He created static web pages and eagerly sought my feedback, but I remained blind to the magic he was conjuring.

<br><br>

One fateful evening during our second year, Tomiwa acquired a new laptop. He generously shared his old laptop and course materials with me,
 hoping to ignite a spark of interest. Yet, I treated it with casual disdain, dismissing the idea of web development as if it were a mere trifle.
  "Who has time for that?" I laughed it off, choosing instead to immerse myself in the virtual world of Grand Theft Auto.

<br><br>

As our laptops hummed with different activities, little did I know that Tomiwa's dedication was about to yield unimaginable rewards.
 One Friday evening, while sharing a simple meal of Indomie, his phone came to life with a notification. As he read the message, 
 his face lit up like a thousand suns, and his fork slipped from his hand.

 <br><br>

Curious, I peered at his phone, and my heart skipped a beat. A substantial sum of money, 250,000 naira to be exact, had been received.
 In jest, I asked if he had turned to online fraud, but his smile was a reflection of genuine accomplishment. "This goes beyond that," he said cryptically.

 <br><br>

Eager to understand his newfound wealth, I urged him to share the story. And so, with pride in his voice,
 he revealed that he had been paid by a client for building a website. My mind reeled with realization:
  Tomiwa had transformed his passion into a lucrative profession.

  <br><br>

As days turned into weeks, Tomiwa's success only grew. He moved us to a better apartment,
 no longer reliant on financial support from his family. Instead, he became the provider for them, 
 a role he embraced with pride. We adorned ourselves in finer clothes and indulged in better gadgets,
  all thanks to Tomiwa's unwavering dedication to web development.

<br><br>

During our third year, we embarked on our internships, both at the same media company. While I toiled away in the media department,
 Tomiwa's brilliance shone in the coveted realm of the IT department. At first, envy threatened to consume me,
  but Tomiwa's generosity and care melted away any bitterness.

<br><br>

As graduation gave way to our service year, Tomiwa's dreams expanded beyond our homeland. He was heading to Canada, 
a land of opportunity and possibilities, along with his family. Oh, how my heart ached with longing, wishing I had taken the same path.

<br><br>
But there was hope. Tomiwa never gave up on me, always encouraging me to follow in his footsteps and learn web development.
 Though I scoffed and pretended not to care, I secretly yearned for the transformation he had experienced.

 <br><br>

Then, one day, Tomiwa called with news that shook me to my core. He asked if I wanted to join him in Canada, 
and he was even willing to sponsor me.I rejected the offer in shame, I am not lazy after all, I just didnâ€™t see a reason to learn a tech skill that was my only mistake.


<br><br>


A week passed, I decided to correct my mistake. I mustered the courage to call Tomiwa again. I swallowed my pride and asked for those
 very course materials I had dismissed before. This time, I was ready to embrace web development with all my heart and soul.
  Tomiwa's life was living proof of the power of tech skills, and I craved the same transformation.

  <br><br>

I refuse to let regret define my life any longer. With every line of code I learn, I will carry the memory of Tomiwa's journey as a beacon of hope in my darkest moments.


<br><br>


Today, as I write these words, I find myself living in San Francisco with my family, where I thrive as a senior software engineer at Google.



Meanwhile, Tomiwa has become an unstoppable force, co-founding a company that caught the attention of Microsoft.
 He gracefully transitioned into retirement, embracing a new role as an investor and a mentor for aspiring champions in the tech world.

 <br><br>

The bottom line is that we both now live comfortably, despite my regret for starting my journey later than I wish I had. 
But, as they say, it's never too late to chase your dreams.

<br><br>

Please, dear reader, learn from my past missteps. Take a step today, embrace the world of tech, and discover the magic of tech skills. 
Don't let regrets hold you back; instead, let them be the catalyst for positive change. Your future awaits, filled with boundless opportunities.

<br><br>

Take the leap into the world of tech, and like Tomiwa and me, you too can find success, fulfillment, 
and a life beyond your wildest dreams. Don't wait any longer; start your tech journey today!
